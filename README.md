This template is a simple data preprocessing processes template widely used in machine learning algorithms.

You need to organize the parameters and directories in the code according to your own dataset.

It is about how much to divide the test_size parameter in the partition section for your exercise and test. You can change it according to your dataset or train with all your data and test with unique values without dividing a train as a test. (Pay attention to the overfitting situation.)
